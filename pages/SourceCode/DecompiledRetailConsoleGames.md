This post contains either decompiled or disassembled source code projects for console games that were sold at retail stores.

If you are interested to see officially released or leaked source code check out this other post:
{% include link-to-other-post.html post="/source-code/retail-console-source-code" description="For the official source code check out this post." %}


To be included in this list the project must have decompiled or disassembled at least 25% of the course code, in order to not pollute the post with hundreds of unfinished projects. An exemption to this rule can be made for consoles with very few reversering projects.


# Nintendo Systems
Nintendo systems are by far the most popular for reverse engineering projects, especially related to 1st party titles such as Mario, Zelda and Pokemon.

## Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)

### Balloon Fight

# Sega Systems
Sega is similar to Nintendo in that most of the games that people are interested in reverse engineering are 1st party titles such as Sonic and Phantasy Star.

## Sega Master System
Although the Sega Master System was hugely popular in Europe, it can't compete with the NES for number of disassembled projects created so far.

### Phantasy Star

## Sega Mega Drive
The Sega Mega Drive was Sega's most popular console in terms of games developed, and as such it also seems to be the most popular for reverse engineering projects too.

### Kid Chameleon

# Sony Systems
Compared to the other systems, Sony doesn't have many decompilation projects, mainly due to the higher complexity of the games developed by the PS1 era, requiring much larger teams to create the games in the first place.

## Playstation 1
